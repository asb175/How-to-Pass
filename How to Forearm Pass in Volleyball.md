# How to Forearm Pass in Volleyball
## By: Ashley Browske




Forearm passing is one of the few skills needed in order to play volleyball. It is commonly the first touch out of the three the team gets. It involves getting your forearms and hands in a position where the volleyball will hit off of them and go to the target. 


## Materials Needed

- A volleyball
    >There are two different balls. One is softer and is used by beginners and the other has a rougher surface used by more advantaged or older players.
- A partner or teammate
- Your arms

## Steps for Passing

Many of these steps happen within miliseconds of each other but the order matters!

1. Face your partner or teammate who is holding the volleyball
2. Have the partner toss the ball towards you
3. Look at where the ball is going
4. Move your feet to adjust to the ball
5. Lock out your elbow so your arms are straight
6. Tilt your shoulders to create an angle
7. Put your hands together (palm on top of palm, thumbs together tilted down)
8. Have ball hit your arms right in the middle of your forearm
9. Hold that angle towards your target

And of course practice makes perfect so keep redoing these steps until you get good at forearm passing.

## Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd dillinger
npm i
node app
```

For production environments...

```sh
npm install --production
NODE_ENV=production node app
```

## Plugins

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins.
Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below.

| Plugin | README |
| ------ | ------ |
| Dropbox | [plugins/dropbox/README.md][PlDb] |
| GitHub | [plugins/github/README.md][PlGh] |
| Google Drive | [plugins/googledrive/README.md][PlGd] |
| OneDrive | [plugins/onedrive/README.md][PlOd] |
| Medium | [plugins/medium/README.md][PlMe] |
| Google Analytics | [plugins/googleanalytics/README.md][PlGa] |

## Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Dillinger uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing.
Make a change in your file and instantaneously see your updates!

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

First Tab:

```sh
node app
```

Second Tab:

```sh
gulp watch
```

(optional) Third:

```sh
karma test
```

#### Building for source

For production release:

```sh
gulp build --prod
```

Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution:

```sh
gulp build dist --prod
```

## Docker

Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the
Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to
build the image.

```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version} .
```

This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies.
Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual
version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on
your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to
port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart=always --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --name=dillinger <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```

> Note: `--capt-add=SYS-ADMIN` is required for PDF rendering.

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in
your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```
